# General
> [!info] Top-level constants
> Top-level refers to declarations that are defined outside classes or functions.
> The declarations are directly contained within a file
> They can be accessed from anywhere in the same file or from other files where the containing package is visible

> [!info] `const val` vs. `val`
> - `const val`'s value is determined at compilation time
> 	- Only works at top-level & in singleton classes declared with `object`
> - `val`'s value is determined during program execution
> 	- Can be assigned by a function at run time
- Kotlin doesn't have a concept of class level constants
> [!info] Companion objects vs. regular objects
> - `Companion objects` are initialized from static constructor of containing class
> -> Created when object is created
> - `Regular objects` are initialized lazily on first access to that object (on first use)

- Use `const val` to make a *top-level* constant and assign it a value at <u>compile time</u>
```kotlin
const val varName = value
```
- Define constant inside a class (Wrap into companion object):
```kotlin
class ClassName {
	companion object {
		const val constName = "value"
	}
}
```
