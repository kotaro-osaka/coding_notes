# General
- Generic type allows making a class generic
	=> More flexibility
- A generic type can fit any type of object
- Definition:
```kotlin
class ClassName<T>
// <T> Is the convention, but can be replaced by other char or string
```
- `<T>`: Can be referenced like any other type | Stands for `Any?` and is nullable | Return is `T`
- Make generic more specific by giving value:
```kotlin
class ClassName<T>(val varName: T)

val instanceName = ClassName("string") // Passes a value
println(instanceName.varName)
```
- `<T: Any?>` == `<T>` | Nullable | Default
- `<T: Any>`: Non-nullable | *Generic constraint*
- Replace `Any` with class to make sure that the passed class or a subclass is passed:
```kotlin
class ClassName<T: OtherClass>(val varName: T)
```
---
- `check()`: Acts as assertion & throws `IllegalStateExeption` if its argument is `false`
```kotlin
// Example
class Aquarium<T: WaterSupply>(val waterSupply: T) {
	fun addWater() {
		check(!waterSupply.needsProcessing) { "water supply needs processing first" }
		println("adding water from $watersupply")
	}
}
```
