# Singleton Class
- Declared as `object` instead of `class`, because every instance does the same
# Enum
- `enum` allows to enumerate something and refer to it by name
- Declared by prefixing declaration with `enum`
```kotlin
// Example:
enum class Color(val rgb: Int) {
	RED(0xFF0000), GREEN(0x00FF00), BLUE(0x0000FF);
}
```
- Get name: `name`
- Get ordinal value(index): `ordinal`
- Get value: `propertyName`
```kotlin
// Example:
enum class Direction(val degrees: Int) {
	NORTH(0), SOUTH(180), EAST(90), WEST(270)
}
fun main() {
	println(Direction.EAST.name)    
	println(Direction.EAST.ordinal)    
	println(Direction.EAST.degrees)
}

=>
EAST
2
90
```
# Sealed Class
- Class that can be subclassed, but only in file in which it's declared
- Restrict inheritance to a fixed set of subclasses within the same file or module
- Great for returning success or error from a network API
