## Random Variables
___
- **Sample Space**: Set of all possible outcomes
- **Event**: Execution of random process
- **Probability**: Chance of event occurring
- **$P(x)$**: Notation to describe probabilities
	- `x`: Chance that random variable takes a specific value of x 
	- Sum of all probabilities for all possible values must equal 1
### Population & Sample

![[population_sample.png|500]]
- **Population**: Set of all observations (individuals, objects, events or procedures)
- **Sample**: Subset of observations from population (ideally true representation of population)
	- Used, because experimenting with entire population too expensive
	- Sample needs to be unbiased -> Statistical sampling techniques
### Mean
- **Mean**: Average; Central value of finite set of numbers
	- aka **Expectation**: $E()$ or $\overline{rdmVar}$
	- E.g.: E(X), E(Y)
		→ $\overline{X}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^NX_i}{N}$
		-> $\overline{Y}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^NY_i}{N}$
- **Sample Mean**: Defined by `μ`; Used to approximate population Mean
