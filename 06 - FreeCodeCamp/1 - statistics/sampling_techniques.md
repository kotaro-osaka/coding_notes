## Random Sampling

![[random_sampling.png|500]]
- Every member of population has equal chance of being selected
- Eliminates bias
- Ensures representativeness if done properly
## Systematic Sampling

![[systematic_sampling.png|500]]
- Selects every `n`th item after random start
- Simple & efficient
- May introduce bias if pattern exists in population list
## Clustered Sampling

![[clustered_sampling.png|500]]
1. Divides population into clusters
2. Randomly selects some clusters to sample
- Useful when population clusters naturally exist
- May not represent all population groups equally
## Weighted Sampling

![[weighted_sampling.png|500]]
- Assigns different probabilities of selection to different population members
- Ensures certain subgroups are adequately represented in sample
## Stratified Sampling

![[stratified_sampling.png|500]]
1. Divides population homogenous subgroups (*strata*)
2. Randomly samples from each *stratum*
- Increases precision by ensuring representation from each subgroup
