# DevOps Engineer
- *Deploying* and *maintaining* existing software
- *Development & Operations*: Write code and make decisions that are critical to the product
	- Some companies organize them into different departments with different goals
- *DevOps*: Combination of both groups
	- Teams work together to release code quickly & safely
- *DevOps Roles*
	- Make automated systems to deploy code
	- Bring organizational changes that increase collaboration between teams
		-> Improve software by releasing new features quickly without breaking old ones
- Roles can be listed as *Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)*, Created by Google in 2003
- Entire release process
- Ensure new features & software is released quickly, low rates of failure, quick fixing
# Machine Learning Engineer
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Build machine learning algorithms
- Focus on writing optimized algorithms that make use of massive amounts of data
	- Can be used to create different products
- Need knowledge of data scientists
- Strong programming skills
- Understanding of software development process
- ~~Producing insights from own analysis~~
	-> Building machine that discovers insights
- Harness data to communicate findings & build a system/product that utilizes the data directly
- Software development + Data science
# Robotics Developer/Engineer
- Next 10 years: Estimated 175% increase in industrial robotics market
- Robotics: Mechanical engineering, electrical engineering & computer science
	-> Movement, System, Program
- Design entire system
# Quantum Computing Researcher
