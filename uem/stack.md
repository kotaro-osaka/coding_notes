### **How Rust Fits in the Stack**

- **Frontend (Kotlin)**:
    
    - User interacts with a clean GUI to set up configurations.
    - User options are sent as API requests to a backend service.
- **Backend Core**:
    
    - Rust handles:
        - Parsing and validating configuration files.
        - Running PowerShell commands securely.
        - Managing file operations for images and templates.
        - Monitoring deployment progress.
- **C++**:
    
    - Handles low-level PXE operations and Windows API interactions where required.

### **Advantages of Using Rust in Combination**

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
    
    - Rust acts as a powerful middle-layer that translates high-level user actions (Kotlin frontend) into efficient, low-level operations (C++ or Rust itself).
2. **Improved Performance and Safety**:
    
    - Rust ensures the backend remains performant and free of memory-related bugs, critical in a tool handling system setups and deployments.
3. **Extensibility**:
    
    - You can add advanced features over time (e.g., real-time monitoring, smarter image management) without major rewrites.
